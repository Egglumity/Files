# Egglumity's FNF Punchy Mod.
To replace my images with the original FNF images, follow directions below vvv
  1. Go to your Friday Night Funkin' folder whever it is on your computer.
  2. Open the "assets" folder
  3. Drop every one of my png files onto the "images" folder.
  4. Click "replace all files".
After successfully replacing every file, the game should be ready to play. Open the game and Punchy should have replaced Pico for every song on week 3.
